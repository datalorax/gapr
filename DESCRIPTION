Description: This is a small package designed to estimate distributional gaps in terms of an effect sizes, along with the associated standard error, using only count data from each distribution. This assumes that the counts are from ordered bins. The ECDF from each distribution is first approximated using these counts (cumulative proportion within each bin). The ECDF's are then paired and a smoothed curve is estimated using maximum likelihood. The area under the curve is then estimated and transformed to an effect size. The variance-covariance matrix associated with the curve fit is also used to estimate the standard error of the effect size.
